            <p>
              SafeBrowsing is a Chrome extension and web app that helps users
              stay safe online. The extension analyzes websites for harmful,
              AI-generated, or scam content, while the web app offers free
              security lessons with quizzes and progress tracking. <br/>Notes: First Hackathon ever, learned a completely "new" languauge, pystream and had to code my butt off for 24 hours.

            <h3> AutoBuy </h3>
            <p>
              AutoBuy is a Selenium-powered automation bot that monitors Best Buy
              for product availability and autonomously completes purchases. It
              uses stealth techniques and human-like interaction patterns to
              bypass bot detection and seamlessly navigate the checkout process. <br/>Notes: One of the first times I ever went outside my coding comfort box. I just googled and learned whatever I needed to finish this passion project. First time working at API's also quite the experience.

            <h3> Safety Tag </h3>
            <p>
              Safety Tag is a wearable emergency device developed for EG1004 at
              NYU Tandon. When the button is pressed, it triggers an audible
              alarm and displays the userâ€™s location on an LCD screen, helping
              others respond quickly in dangerous situations.

              <br/>Notes: It was one of my first times ever coding in a group enviorment. Even though it was a struggle, it was fun doing it together.
